# Chess AI in Pure HTML5, CSS3 & Javascript

## This project was made with pure javascript so that it may be played in the browser without any dependencies like JQuery.

This repo consists of a chess game where you play as the white player. The ai plays as black. The AI will only think two moves in the future.


The AI currently uses :
* Negamax
* Simple Piece Value Evaluation

Expected updates includes:
* Piece Square Table
* Null Move Detection
* Quiescence Search
